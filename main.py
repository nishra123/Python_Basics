"""Python uses modules that are of two types:
1)In- Built Modules: These are already present in python interpreter.
eg. random(used to generate random numbers)

2)Extra modules: these are modules that are available on the internet but not present on python interpreter
eg. flask, pandas

'pip' acts as a package manager and helps to find extra modules from the internet to incorporate within the python interpreter.

For incorporation of new modules,
Go to 'Windows Powershell' or 'Command Prompt'
type: pip install (module name)

it will get installed automatically.

to exit, type:exit()
